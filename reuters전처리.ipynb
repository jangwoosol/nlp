to help the economy the fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a fullblown recession said raymond stone chief financial economist at merrill lynch capital markets stone said economic data available by late june may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut but he said it may only be a quarterpoint drop instead of the usual half point to avoid hurting the dollar further all of the economists agreed that the federal open market committee tomorrow will leave fed policy unchanged the average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarterpoint drops by the end of june in both the treasury bond yield to 712 pct and the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another to 578 pct most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 712 pct other broad predictions of the survey relating mainly to the apriljune quarter follow  the dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large us budget deficit and a wide but narrowing trade gap contacted after the dollars steep drop in the last two business days the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more rather than less than they expect  oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range  stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest secondhalf economic rise the outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up  inflation as measured by the gnp implicit price deflator will rise to around 33 pct this year from 27 pct in 1986

robert brusca of nikko securities co international sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed he expects real gnp which grew at a 11 pct rate in fourthquarter 1986 to expand at a 33 pct rate this quarter and 35 pct next quarter the economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect brusca said he said an involuntary buildup in inventories largely in autos will add to firstquarter economic growth with consumer spending helping later were running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat said philip braverman of irving securities corp his interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter gnp growth respectively he expects 25 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories lower capital investment slow government spending and less construction only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth he sees a 710 pct endofjune yield on treasury bonds with federal funds and prime rates at 550 and

to help the economy the fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a fullblown recession said raymond stone chief financial economist at merrill lynch capital markets stone said economic data available by late june may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut but he said it may only be a quarterpoint drop instead of the usual half point to avoid hurting the dollar further all of the economists agreed that the federal open market committee tomorrow will leave fed policy unchanged the average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarterpoint drops by the end of june in both the treasury bond yield to 712 pct and the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another to 578 pct most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 712 pct other broad predictions of the survey relating mainly to the apriljune quarter follow  the dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large us budget deficit and a wide but narrowing trade gap contacted after the dollars steep drop in the last two business days the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more rather than less than they expect  oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range  stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest secondhalf economic rise the outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up  inflation as measured by the gnp implicit price deflator will rise to around 33 pct this year from 27 pct in 1986 the sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year  us real gross national product which grew at a two pct annual rate in the

robert brusca of nikko securities co international sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed he expects real gnp which grew at a 11 pct rate in fourthquarter 1986 to expand at a 33 pct rate this quarter and 35 pct next quarter the economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect brusca said he said an involuntary buildup in inventories largely in autos will add to firstquarter economic growth with consumer spending helping later were running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat said philip braverman of irving securities corp his interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter gnp growth respectively he expects 25 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories lower capital investment slow government spending and less construction only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth he sees a 710 pct endofjune yield on treasury bonds with federal funds and prime rates at 550 and seven pct respectively nikkos brusca projects rates of 825 pct for bonds 615 pct for funds and 775 pct for the prime rate two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollars

and straining the accords support operations  and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by nonmembers undermining the pacts consumers and producers mindful of itc buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed the international cocoa organization icco last week set precise limits on what the buffer stock manager bsm could do under the new agreement it imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the bsm from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of nonmember cocoa this will

coffee organization ico negotiations in london exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said consumers and a small group of producers

quota share of 30 pct the talks broke down and although an ico executive board meeting starts in london today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote international agreements exist for sugar and wheat these do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat an alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with

administration policy states the us currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses  the international coffee agreement ica and inra  but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts the us did not join the international cocoa agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the state department said us officials singled out the inra as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working us negotiators were successful in getting other members of the

economist in the west german ministry of agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements peter baron told reuters in london agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously but baron added no real sanctions are available for a country that doesnt stick to its obligationsthe german approach is sceptical we dont think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries they were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them traditionally britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with third world producing countries but recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown british officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid it is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of openended borrowing that occurred in the tin

rate drop in the second quarter analysts said a poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower with the fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 512 pct late next quarter to help the economy the fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a fullblown recession said raymond stone chief financial economist at merrill lynch capital markets stone said economic data available by late june may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut but he said it may only be a quarterpoint drop instead of the usual half point to avoid hurting the dollar further all of the economists agreed that the federal open market committee tomorrow will leave fed policy unchanged the average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarterpoint drops by the end of june in both the treasury bond yield to 712 pct and the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another to 578 pct most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 712 pct other broad predictions of the survey relating mainly to the apriljune quarter follow  the dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large us budget deficit and a wide but narrowing trade gap contacted after the dollars steep drop in the last two business days the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more rather than less than they expect  oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range  stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest secondhalf economic rise the outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up  inflation as measured by the gnp implicit price deflator will rise to around 33 pct this year from 27 pct in 1986 the sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year  us real gross national product which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half should expand at respective rates of about 23 pct and 25 pct in the 1987 first and second halves firstquarter growth is put at a 24 pct annual rate slowing to 21 pct next quarter robert brusca of nikko securities co international sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed he expects real gnp which grew at a 11 pct rate in fourthquarter 1986 to expand at a 33 pct rate this quarter and 35 pct next quarter the economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect brusca said he said an involuntary buildup in inventories largely in autos will add to firstquarter economic growth with consumer spending helping later were running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat said philip braverman of irving securities corp his interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter gnp growth respectively he expects 25 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories lower capital investment slow government spending and less construction only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth he sees a 710 pct endofjune yield on treasury bonds with federal funds and prime rates at 550 and seven pct respectively nikkos brusca projects rates of 825 pct for bonds 615 pct for funds and 775 pct for the prime rate two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollars

quota share of 30 pct the talks broke down and although an ico executive board meeting starts in london today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote international agreements exist for sugar and wheat these do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect

exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat an alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with

function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously but baron added no real sanctions are available for a country that doesnt stick to its obligationsthe german approach is sceptical we dont think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries they were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them traditionally britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with third world producing countries but recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown british officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid it is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of openended borrowing that occurred in the tin

to help the economy the fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a fullblown recession said raymond stone chief financial economist at merrill lynch capital markets stone said economic data available by late june may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut but he said it may only be a quarterpoint drop instead of the usual half point to avoid hurting the dollar further all of the economists agreed that the federal open market committee tomorrow will leave fed policy unchanged the average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarterpoint drops by the end of june in both the treasury bond yield to 712 pct and the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another to 578 pct most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 712 pct other broad predictions of the survey relating mainly to the apriljune quarter follow  the dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large us budget deficit and a wide but narrowing trade gap contacted after the dollars steep drop in the last two business days the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more rather than less than they expect  oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range  stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest secondhalf economic rise the outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up  inflation as measured by the gnp implicit price deflator will rise to around 33 pct this year from 27 pct in 1986

robert brusca of nikko securities co international sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed he expects real gnp which grew at a 11 pct rate in fourthquarter 1986 to expand at a 33 pct rate this quarter and 35 pct next quarter the economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect brusca said he said an involuntary buildup in inventories largely in autos will add to firstquarter economic growth with consumer spending helping later were running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat said philip braverman of irving securities corp his interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter gnp growth respectively he expects 25 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories lower capital investment slow government spending and less construction only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth he sees a 710 pct endofjune yield on treasury bonds with federal funds and prime rates at 550 and
